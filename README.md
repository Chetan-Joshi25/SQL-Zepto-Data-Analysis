# SQL-Zepto-Data-Analysis
##  Project Overview

The goal is to simulate how actual data analysts in the e-commerce or retail industries work behind the scenes to use SQL to:

✅ Set up a messy, real-world e-commerce inventory **database**

✅ Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to explore product categories, availability, and pricing inconsistencies

✅ Implement **Data Cleaning** to handle null values, remove invalid entries, and convert pricing from paise to rupees

✅ Write **business-driven SQL queries** to derive insights around **pricing, inventory, stock availability, revenue** and more

### Business Insights
- Found top 10 best-value products based on discount percentage

- Identified high-MRP products that are currently out of stock

- Estimated potential revenue for each product category

- Filtered expensive products (MRP > ₹500) with minimal discount

- Ranked top 5 categories offering highest average discounts

- Calculated price per gram to identify value-for-money products

- Grouped products based on weight into Low, Medium, and Bulk categories

- Measured total inventory weight per product category
